# Facebook Ads Click Prediction - ML & ANN

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting user clicks on Facebook ads using traditional Machine Learning models and Deep Learning. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow, Keras

## Main Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Model building:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Cross-validation and performance comparison

## Key Results
- ANN achieved the best predictive performance among all models.
- Proper feature scaling and outlier treatment significantly improved model accuracy.
